# Grouper to Midpoint Demonstration Class

This is a class to demonstrate the usage of the
Unicon RabbitMQ plugin for Grouper, in conjuction
with midPoint's rest interface.

The below several static strings for configuration information
are inside the class itself.

EXCHANGE_NAME
EXCHANGE_HOST
EXCHANGE_USER
EXCHANGE_SECRET
MIDPOINT_REST_URL
MIDPOINT_REST_USER
MIDPOINT_REST_SECRET

There is also two HashMaps that can be used to define
which groups membership additions and deletions should
result in adding or removing roles or resources in midPoint.

roleGroups
resourceGroups

For example the mapping:

roleGroups.put("ref:employee","employee");

Would add the midPoint employee role to a user when their subjectId was addedd to the ref:employee Grouper group.

After building you should be able to run with the below syntax.

java -classpath groupermidpoint-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.unc.tier.groupermidpoint.GrouperToMidpoint
